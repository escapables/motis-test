# Current TODO

- [ ] 1. Verify latest GitHub Actions run for `master` succeeds (all required jobs green).
- [ ] 2. Triage and fix remaining open GitHub issues relevant to this fork.
- [ ] 3. Re-clone the repository into a clean temp directory under `~`.
- [ ] 4. Run a clean end-to-end build from the fresh clone.
- [ ] 5. Validate bundle startup and core flows after clean build (import data + run app).
- [ ] 6. Document retest outcome and any follow-up fixes needed.
- [ ] 7. Create and maintain a mislabel inventory (wrong mode/icon/line classification), then execute one bulk normalization fix pass.
- [ ] 8. Review the codebase against `~/projects/agents/AGENTS.md` guidelines and `~/projects/motis-portable/docs` guardrails; document findings and create follow-up fix tasks. Reminder: also check against `~/projects/motis-portable/docs/STYLE.md`.
